JRDP - A Java Remote Desktop Protocol Client Library
====

Work originally started on Apr/10, and halted in Jan/11. I am now open sourcing this, because why not!

Project designed for android studio and gradle, which is has recently been updated to use.

The core library has a functional rdp client, but the android client needs a ton of work [this is where dev stalled].
